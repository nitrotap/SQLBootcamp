/* Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
An ERD shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database
Returns: Primary Key(PK): order_id   Foreign Keys(FK): return_date, return_quantity, reason_returned
Customers: PK: customer_id
Products: PK: product_id
Regions: PK: region_id
Orders: PK: order_id FK: customer_id, product_id, region_id

-- SQL Order of Construction
SELECT -- picks the columns
SELECT DISTINCT -- returns a unique combination of values for all columns selected, name the columsn you want, without duplicates
FROM -- points to the tables
JOIN -- (also called INNER JOIN) used to combine data across two different tables, name the primary table
     -- CREATES NULLS
LEFT JOIN -- loads all entries that appear in the first table with NULLs where there is no match, name the secondary table
RIGHT JOIN -- loads all entries that appear in the second table with NULLS with no match, name the secondary table
ON -- Specify the KEY to join the two tables, set keys equal to each other // orders.region_id = regions.region_id
UNION --  Combine rows from multiple tables with the SAME columns
-- follow UNION with SELECT col1 // FROM table2
WHERE -- puts filters on rows
GROUP BY -- aggregates across values of a variable
HAVING -- filters aggregated values after they have been grouped
ORDER BY -- sorts the results, // column1 (ASC/DESC)
LIMIT -- limits results to the first n rows

/* Practicing Good SQL Grammar
Common punctuation:
● Signal the end of your SQL query with a semicolon (;).
● Commas separate column names in an output list (,).
● Use single quotations around text/strings ('Nokia').
Query code spacing:
● SQL only requires a single white space to separate elements.
● Carriage returns are often used to enhance readability.
Notes within queries:
● Always provide comments (source, revision, author, etc.).
● Comments are made after typing double dashes or the pair /* */

/* WHERE  -- FILTERING the data
List of Operators
<>, != Not equal to.
>, >= Greater than; greater than or equal to.
<, <= Less than; less than or equal to.
AND: Returns if both conditions are true.
OR: Returns if either condition is true (FALSE if neither is true).
( ): Parentheses group conditions to set all equal to TRUE.
IN(): Found in a list of items
BETWEEN(): Within the range of, including boundaries
NOT: Negates a conditions
LIKE, ILIKE: Contains item; ILIKE disregards case
%: Wildcard; none to many characters
_: Wildcard; single characters
